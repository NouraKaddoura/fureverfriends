### Technology
    * Ruby on Rails (Ruby version 2.5.0)

    * Postgresql

    * Bcrypt

    * Bootstrap

    * HTML
    
    * CSS/SASS

### Approach

planning for this app started with focusing on the first two main models and then determing the key user stories for that model. I built a trello board to help stay on track.
